# Credit-Risk-Analysis-using-ML-algorithms
Unlock the power of machine learning to predict non-performing loans! This project offers a complete pipeline—from data preprocessing to model optimization—designed to help financial institutions proactively manage credit risk. Dive in to explore cutting-edge algorithms and ensure smarter, data-driven decisions in lending.
## Project Stages

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Importing Libraries:** Essential Python libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` are used.
- **Loading the Dataset:** The dataset is loaded into a DataFrame for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical methods are used to understand the data distribution and identify any anomalies.

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Handling Missing Values:** Strategies to manage missing data points.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Transforming categorical data into numerical format.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalizing data to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

### 3. Model Selection and Training

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Various ML algorithms are tested, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and others.
- **Model Evaluation:** The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

### 4. Model Optimization

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Techniques like GridSearchCV are used to find the optimal parameters for the best-performing model.

### 5. Prediction and Conclusion

- **Final Model:** The final model is selected based on its performance metrics.
- **Prediction:** The model is used to predict the likelihood of loans becoming non-performing.
